# Level-1-Task-2-Portfolio-Website
In Task 2, I developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills and projects. This project involved HTML and CSS to structure sections for my bio, skills, and contact information, along with a space for my resume. I included an introductory image, contact details, and customized styles to reflect my personal brand.
